****************************** House-DOS System Call Documentation ******************************
=================================================================================================

This document contains information about all the system calls available in House-DOS/Assembly
programming, as well as some general information about using these system calls.

I. Writing Commands/Implementation

House-DOS commands are written in real mode x86 assembly language. There is no need to worry
about segmentation or preserving register states, as the kernel takes care of this.

There are various system calls available to commands, and these are called by setting parameters
in various registers, and calling on interrupt 0x7E. Here is an example of a system call to print
out a string:

    mov ah, 0x02
    mov si, string_mem_location
    int 0x7E

In this example, the string (terminated with NULL char) pointed to by SI will be printed out, and
the cursor will be moved one line down. The following sections contain details on all the system
calls available.

Out of the system calls listed, the ones marked with an asterisk (*) have not yet been
implemented, but are planned.


II. Basic Functions

    HANDBACK
        AH = 0xFF

        Signals the end of the command. When this is used, command execution will stop and
        House-DOS will prompt the user for a new command.
